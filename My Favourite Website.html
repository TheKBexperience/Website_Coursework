    <p id="GGText">So i spend most of my time at home at my computer, so here is a small list of the websites i spend most of my time looking at. The first one i probably spend most of my time on
    has to be Youtube, more specifically the GameGrumps channel, i love this channel, i really like the humor and the witty banter that goes on between the two hosts of the show, they usually
    spend most of their time playing recent games while adding hilarious commentary, but they are known to play old classics in long playing series. </p>

    <p id="RDText">I spend alot of time browsing through Reddit, Reddit has loads of different pages about all the things on this planet, there is literally a page for everything! These typical pages are typically
    known as Subreddits, my personal favourite Subreddit is r/Gaming, i can spend hours looking through all the diffrent picutures and review about recent and old games, there is loads of peoples cool
    artwork and build projects also posted. I usually just use it to find out the latest gaming news but can get lost looking at cool pictures or funny videos. </p>

    <p id="WoWText">One of my favourite games is World of Warcraft, so because of this i often check the World of Warcraft website for updates being added to the game, game patch notes and release dates. The website also
    allows you to login to your account so you can see updated recent activity about your characters, from here you can view your achievements, your current armour and specialisation, you can also see the recent
    activity of your guild members and any progress they have made within the game.</p>

    </a>
    <p id="BBCText">As a Football fan i like to try and watch most of the Games on TV when i can, The team i follow and support is Liverpool FC, if i cant watch one of their games i will go onto the BBC Sport
    website to have alook at the results of their games, from here i can see who was playing, who scored and assisted, the time of the goals and any substitutions made and of course the final score. The
    website also allows you to view the current league table so you can follow your team as they gain points each week.</p>
