<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am Kyle Brebner, a 20 year old student currently in my third year of study at Robert Gordon's University, I study Computer Network Management and Design and am about to start my fourth year after the summer break. I choose to study Networking
    as it was a very intresting subject to me when i was at school, i never understood how computers communicated or how data was sent across the internet and wanted to know more, so once i left my 6th year of study at the Aberdeen Grammar School
    I went on to study Computer Networking at North East Scotland Collage. I Spent 2 years at College furthering my skills in the Networking world before I decided I wanted to know and learn more, after i graduated from Collage i began studying at
    the University.</p>

<h2>My Work</h2>

<p>I currently work at USC Fashion in union square, i have worked here for 3 and a half years. I am currently employed as a Denim Specialist, this means i work in the denim section, helping customers find their size and style while keeping
i clean and tidy work environment. My work here has been slowing building up a reputation thanks to my long service and great standards, i have one many awards and vouchers for my excellent service within the department, because of this, my store's
denim department has became model store, meaning that all other stores across the UK must make their store look like mine as its pictures are displayed within the model store pack. The staff within the store are all great and wounderful people
who I get along with greatly, I made a few life-long friends working here along side loads of new friends, I even met my current girlfriend while working here. The Staff are a great social bunch and we like to go out often whether it be watching
sports through the day or going out at night, we even regularly play football on sundays to have fun and keep fit.</p>

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>

<p>I dont have alot of hobbies, my main one is going to the gym, I am keen to start Bodybuilding as it is the category that I like the most about the gym, I like to look after my body and i feel that Bodybuilding shapes and defines it the
most, I struggle to stick to diets and to find the time with work and uni but i do my best to go when i can, my biggest inspiration for it all is Calum Von Moger, a 3 time Mr Universe winner and Cellucor Athlete, he is a young bodybuilder that is
said to be the new arnorld thanks to their simulor workout patters and physic. With the rest of my spare time I just spend the rest of it at home, either on my PS4 or at my Computer, I play alot of video games and i like to vairy my choises
by switching between Console and PC gaming, my favourite game is World of Warcraft, iv played with game for about 8 years now, my other favourites include League of Legends, The Witcher 3, Destiny, Diablo 3 and Skyrim. </p>
